Blood Bank Management System Website - Project Description
The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a web-based application developed to streamline the process of managing blood donations, requests, and inventory across hospitals and blood banks. The platform acts as a centralized system where donors, recipients, and administrators can interact efficiently.

Key Features:

Donor Registration: Donors can sign up, provide personal details, blood group, and availability to donate.
Recipient Requests: Patients or hospitals in need of blood can raise requests specifying blood group, quantity, and urgency.
Blood Inventory Management: The system keeps real-time track of available blood units categorized by blood group and type.
Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage donor records, approve or decline blood requests, and oversee blood stock levels.
